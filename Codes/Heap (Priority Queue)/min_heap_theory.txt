/*
Min Heap - 
    -> It is a complete binary tree
    -> Every node has values smaller than its descendants. It means this node is going to be smaller than it's children
    -> NOTE that this property is not same as that as Binary Search Tree
    -> Min Heap is internally represented as an array. By internal, I mean in-memory

    Therefore, the mathematical properties apply to it:
    1. left(i) = 2i + 1;
    2. right(i) = 2i + 2;
    3. parent(i) = floor((i-1)/2);
