Maven VS Gradle

1. Maven is mainly focussed on Java, whereas gradle focusses on adding functionality to any language projects. HOW????
2. Maven focusses on developing applications within the deadlines whereas Gradle focuses on developing apps by adding new features. HOW???
3. Maven uses xml to make project structure whereas Gradle doesn't use that. It uses groovy based domain specific language for making project structre.
4. Gradle supports more languages.
5. Gradle is much more customizable than Maven, but this sort of makes Gradle a little bit complex for noobs
6. Maven does not have build cache, therefore it is a lot slower than Gradle.
