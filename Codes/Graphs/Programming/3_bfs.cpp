/*

    Given : We are given a adjacency list graph, we have to print the BFS of that list
    How is BFS defined here, we would be given a starting node or reference node, we print that vertex first, then all the vertices connected to that node
    Then we print all the connected nodes of those vertices which we just mentioned above. Repetetion is not allowed

    We can make a set for traversed elements, if the element is not there, we have not traversed it.
    Then we traverse that element and it's related items and insert in set. We do not have to print set elements, we can print while traversing, it will reduce 1 traversal
