Walk - When we traverse the vertices, the nodes that we travel, that series is called a walk.

Path - It is a special walk with no repretion of vertices.

Cyclic - There exists a vertex that begins and ends with the same vertex.

Adjacency:
    -> Adjacent vertices - If there is an edge between 2 vertices.
    -> Adjacent edges - If there is a common vertex between 2 edges
