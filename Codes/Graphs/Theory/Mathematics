In a undirected graph
-> Degree of a vertex is - Number of edges passing through it. (Incoming or outgoing)
-> Sum of degrees - 2 * number of edges
-> Maximum number of edges - (v * (v-1) ) / 2
    -> How did we get this expression
    -> Every vertex (total v) is connected to v-1 vertices. (Same as directed graph)
    -> But this time, an edge represents 2 connections, so the number of connections is reduced to half.
    -> Therefore (v * (v-1)) / 2;
    -> Such undirected graph is also called a complete graph

In a Directed Graph - 
-> Indegree - Number of edges coming towards it
-> Outdegree - Number of edges going out of it.

-> Sum of Indegrees - Total number of edges
-> Sum of Outdegree - Also total number of edges

-> Maximum number of edges in a directed graph - v * (v - 1 ) {We are not considering self loop in this}
    -> We get this expression by this logic
    -> Every vertex (total v) is connected to v-1 vertices. Therefore total number of edges = v * v-1
    -> This makes a graph, complete graph
