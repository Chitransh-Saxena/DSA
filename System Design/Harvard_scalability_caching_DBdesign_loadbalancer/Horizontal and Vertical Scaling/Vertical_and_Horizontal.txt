Vertical Scaling - 
	-> If we are hosting a website that is serving a lot of media and stuff, and suddenly we have a lot of users, easy solution to this problem is add more resources
	-> if we are low on RAM, add RAM ...etc
	-> At times when we need faster access to storage, we can go for SSD or SAS drive.
	-> SSD is an electrical drive, no moving or rotational parts.

Problems with this ?
	-> A big financial constraint
	-> Machines are not customized according to us.
	
	
Horizontal Scaling - 

-> Use of cheaper hardware, but a bunch of machines.
-> If we have multiple requests coming for a service, we just balance that traffic to these multiple servers.
-> A Load Balancer comes into picture here. (nginx, it is a DNS gateway)

-> A slight modification we can make is, instead of having multiple servers which are exactly the same, we can have dedicated servers for each and everything.
