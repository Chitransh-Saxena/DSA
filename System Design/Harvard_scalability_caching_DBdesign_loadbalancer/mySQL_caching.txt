MySQL - 

-> It provides some level of caching in itself for identically executed queries
-> It proves useful when there is a user who is navigating a lot back and forth


Memcached - 

	-> It is a mechanism which stores whatever we want in a RAM
	-> This can be either on the same server as the webserver or an entirely different server

	-> Use mechanism is similar to how REDIS looks like
		-> We have a host and the port
		-> We set the data via some library to that
		-> Now, in our program, we just go and fetch it.
