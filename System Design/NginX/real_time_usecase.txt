-> It is basically a gateway that allows port forwarding so that we do not have to expose the port numbers in the application
-> It is present for the APIs and their respective war file
-> nginx also does a load balancing. We can define variables like weight, failure_retries and all that.

So, how does nginx actually work?

-> nginx is a webserver, so it is like an application that is hosted on a certain port. (443 usually)
-> So, if we have any request to any domain name, like https://myapiURL, since it has 'https' protocol, the request will go to nginx gateway.
-> Now, the nginx will resolve the request and select which API is it for (there is a separate file with .conf extention which has rules and instructions and port forwarding for each API)
-> So, now the port will be resolved, the server name is resolved via nginx, and the request will go to that server:port_number
-> We can have a application hosted on that server:port or we may even be having a docker container running as a service, which is listening for an API request.

-> Also, nginx is wrapped up in a docker container, sometimes.
-> Since nginx is programmed to be always listening, nginx is always up and running.
