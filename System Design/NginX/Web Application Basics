A web application is a piece of software that can be accessed via a browser
A web server is something that can host multiple web applications. For the time being we are gonna call the web application a web server

A web server is basically a network application that is running on a machine (probably some server) and listening to some port.

Browser is called a web client or user agent. Any application that can speak to a web server is a web client, like curl or telnet

Now, to interact with each other (web client and web server), they need to use same set of rules, called the protocols.
    Some standard protocols are HTTP, HTTPS, Web Socket, FTP, SMTP (For Mail) ...etc. Each protocol is used for different tasks.
For web client and server interaction, mostly HTTP or HTTPS is used.

Understanding HTTP - 
    What is a Web Resource ?
    -> It is a document which is hosted by a web server or we can say that a web client can access those documents via a web server.
    -> The resource could be static(pdf, json, html etc) or dynamic (generated on the fly, web server builds the resource, example: something that involves current timestamp)
    -> Each resource in the work is identified by a unique string, called a URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
    -> In a URL: http://www.youtube.com/blablabla. Here, http:// is the protocol, www.youtube.com is the web server name, blablabla is the resource we wanna access (Path of resource in the webserver).

    HTTP is a request response protocol
    -> This means, for each action that needs to be performed, the web client first estabelishes a connection with the web server.
    -> Then for executing the task, it sends a request. It has the details, obviously
    -> Web Server responds back to the client (200, 400, 302 etc) based on how the request was completed.
    -> This one pair of request and response is called a transaction.
    -> Once the respnse is recieved, the connection is closed. Now for a new request a new connection has to be made.
    -> Because of this nature, HTTP is called a stateless protocol.
