When to use caching?

	-> When we wanna reduce the DB calls and improve the response time
	-> When we have to make a Remote Call to a different service with high enough latency (delay)
		-> In that case we will cache the response of that system locally at our end
		
Tools to use for caching? - Redis, memcached

In case of things like media, full files, we do not store them in DB. (We can store paths as strings at max)
But that is stored in places like "blob storage"
