Process Vs Threads

1. Multithreading - 
    -> A thread is faster to start, it is usually slower and complicated to start a process
        -> Why is it slower to start a process?
        -> Because OS needs to allocate a bunch of resources to manage a process
    -> Thread is a lightweight process
    -> Thread takes lower overhead
        -> OS needs to provide a lot of protection so that one process does not accidentally step onto another process
    -> Communication :
        -> Processes communicate via Interprocess Communication Channels like message queues, files, pipes
        -> Threads communicate via shared memory
    
    -> Therefore, threads provide a better performance

    Cons of Multithreading Model
    
    -> It is complicated to implement a thread based Model
    -> It cannot be run on a distributed system, multiprocess model can be easily distributed
        -> One work around could be that threads should communicate via IPC
