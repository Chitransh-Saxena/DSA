#include <iostream>

// Struct vs class
// Almost no difference, apart from visibility
/*
    Class - If we do not specifiy any access modifier, a class is private by default
    Struct - Everything is public by default. It exists in C++ to maintain backwards compatibility with C.

    So, if we wanna talk about usage, we can use struct when it comes to Plain Old Data (POD). So, if we want a data type that has different data types in it
    Like, linked list node, or something like that, we can use struct

    Classes are more of like a well defined big package of different data types and methods to get or set or manipulate those variables.

    Btw, inheritence works in both classes and structures, but C struct is different from C++ struct.
